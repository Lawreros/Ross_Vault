This is where I'll be putting my ideas about protocols for reading and processing manuscripts.

| color  | meaning                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Yellow | General Importance                   |
| Red    | Unknown Concept                      |
| Green  | Dataset Used|
| Blue   | Important Methods                    |
| Purple | Data Source                          |
- When adding manuscript to notes, change the red highlighting if the concepts are no longer unknown (i.e. I've made a note about them)

I'll use zotero to onboard and read the manuscripts, putting them into `.toread`. Then, when I have time I'll be highlighting them the relevant colors as I read. If they are just papers, I'll put them into `.read`, if they are worth creating obsidian notes about, I'll put them into the `.tonotes` folder, create notes about them, and then move them to `.read` area.

- I really should come up with some further differentiation of papers, but this should work for a trail run
