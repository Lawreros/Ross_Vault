# Manuscript Reading Protocol
This is the protocol for reading and incorporating new papers into my notes:

### Discovery:
- Papers that I consider interesting will get a cursory reading before being downloaded for further reading
- Papers should be included which are either good introductions to multiple topics or are interesting by the sum of their parts

### Zotero:
- Papers worth further documentation are then downloaded into Zotero, putting them into the `.toread` collection
- Papers will then be selected from the collection in `.toread` in order 
- When I have time to read I'll be highlighting them the relevant colors as I read. If they are just papers, I'll put them into `.read`, if they are worth creating obsidian notes about, I'll put them into the `.tonotes` folder, create notes about them, and then move them to `.read` area.

### Reading:
- Reading the manuscripts will take the following 
| color  | meaning                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Yellow | General Importance                   |
| Red    | Unknown Concept                      |
| Green  | Dataset Used|
| Blue   | Important Methods                    |
| Purple | Data Source                          |
- When adding manuscript to notes, change the red highlighting if the concepts are no longer unknown (i.e. I've made a note about them)

### Obsidian
