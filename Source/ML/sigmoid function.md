A sigmoid function is a mathematical function which has a characteristic "S"-shaped curve or sigmoid curve. A common example of the sigmoid function is defined by the formula:
$$\sigma(x) = \frac{1}{1+e^{-x}}$$
where $x \in \mathbb{R}$. This function serves to take any input value $x$ and bound the output value between $0$ and $1$, with $\sigma(0) = 0.5$
