###### Content:
Similar to the [[F-score]], but where [[precision]] is weighted twice as much as [[recall]] (twice as important). From the generalized equation for [[F-score]]:
$$F_{0.5} = (1+0.5^2) * \frac{precision * recall}{(0.5^2 * precision) + recall} = \frac{(1+0.5^2)TP}{(1+0.5^2)TP+0.5^2*FP+FN}$$
