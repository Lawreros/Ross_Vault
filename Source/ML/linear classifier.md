###### Content:
A linear classifier performs [[classification]] of data based on the value of a linear combination of the characteristics. In other words, a linear classifier only takes the [[dot product]] of the input data with some weight vector.

If the input feature vector to the classifier is a real vector $x$, then the output score is:
$$y = f(w\cdot x) = f(\sum_j w_j x_j)$$
where $w$ is a real vector of weights and $f$ is a function that converts the [[dot product]] of the two vectors into the desired output (in other words, $w$ is a [[linear functional]] mapping $x$ to $\mathbb{R}$)
