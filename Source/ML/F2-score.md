###### Content:
Similar to the [[F-score]], but where [[recall]] is weighted twice as much as [[precision]] (aka, twice as important). From the generalized equation for [[F-score]]:
$$F_2 = (1+2^2) * \frac{precision * recall}{(2^2 * precision) + recall} = \frac{(1+2^2)TP}{(1+2^2)TP+2^2*FP+FN}$$

###### Properties:
