###### Content:
The objective of a linear programming problem will be to maximize or to minimize some numerical value. The objective function indicates how much each variable contributes to the value to be optimized in the problem. The objective function takes the following general form:
$$\text{maximize or minimize} Z = \sum_{i=1}^nc_iX_i$$
where:
$c_i=$ the objective function coefficient corresponding to the $i^{th}$ variable
$X_i =$ the $i^{th}$ decision variable

The coefficients of the objective function indicate the contribution to the value of the objective function of one unit of the corresponding variable. As an example, if the problem is to minimize the cost of achieving some goal, $X_i$ might be the amount of resource $i$ used in achieving the goal. In this case, $c_i$ would be the cost of using one unit of resource $i$.
