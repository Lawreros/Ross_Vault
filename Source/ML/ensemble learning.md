###### Content:
In machine learning, ensemble learning algorithms incorporate the outputs of several different models (which may or may not be of the same type) when performing a prediction. This could be something as simple as what is done with [[random forest]]s, where the output of each [[decision tree]] in the forest is aggregated and a single output is calculated.

Empirically, ensembles tent to yield better results when there is significant diversity among the models. Although perhaps non-intuitive, more random algorithms (like [[random forest]]s) can be used to produce a stronger ensemble than very deliberate algorithm.

**Common types of ensembles:**
- [[bagging]]
- [[boosting]]
