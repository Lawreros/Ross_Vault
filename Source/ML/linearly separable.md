###### Content:
Two sets of points in two dimensions are called "linearly separable" if there exists at least one line in the plane which has all points from one set on one side of the line and all points from the other set on the other side of the line.

This idea generalizes to higher-dimensional spaces if the line is replaced by a hyperplane.
