###### Content:
A fully convolutional network is a [[neural network]] that only performs convolution (and subsampling and upsampling) operations. It does not contain any [[fully connected layer]]s, instead using 1x1 convolutions that perform that ask of fully connected layers. This allows for the input image to be variable in size.

As an example, a [[U-Net]] is a fully convolutional network

###### Properties:
- A fully convolutional network is a [[convolutional neural network]] without any [[fully connected layer]]s
