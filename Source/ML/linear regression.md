###### Content:
The linear [[regression]] algorithm is one of the simplest ML models. A linear regression model makes a prediction by simply computing a weighted sum of the input features, plus a constant called the bias term.

Let $\hat{y}$ be the prediction made by the model, let $x \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be a vector of features, let $b \in \mathbb{R}$ be the bias term, and let $a \in \mathbb{R}^n$ be a vector of weights. The linear regression model makes a prediction using the equation:
$$\hat{y} = b+ a \cdot x = b+a_1x_1+a_2x_2+...+a_nx_n$$
