###### Content:
The RMSE of an estimator $\theta$ with respect to the predicted parameter $\hat{\theta}$ is defined as the square root of the [[mean squared error]]:

$$RMSD(\hat{\theta}) = \sqrt{MSE(\hat{\theta})}$$

###### Properties:
- A value of 0 for the RMSE indicates a perfect fit of the data, with the larger the RMSE inversely correlating with the quality of the prediction

###### Additional Thoughts:
