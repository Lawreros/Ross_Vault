###### Content:
Rust supports the basic mathematical operations you'd expect for all the number types. Each expression in these statements uses a mathematical operator and evaluates to a single value, which is then bound to a variable.

```rust
fn main() { 
	// addition 
	let sum = 5 + 10; 
	
	// subtraction 
	let difference = 95.5 - 4.3; 
	
	// multiplication 
	let product = 4 * 30; 
	
	// division 
	let quotient = 56.7 / 32.2; 
	
	// remainder 
	let remainder = 43 % 5; 
}
```
