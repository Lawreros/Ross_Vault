###### Content:
A file which contains the configuration information [[cargo]] needs to compile a program: the name, the version, who wrote it, and the edition of Rust to use. This file is in TOML format.

```rust
[package]
name = "hello_cargo"
version = "0.1.0"
authors = ["Your Name <you@example.com>"]
edition = "2018"

[dependencies]
```
The first line, `[package]`, is a section heading that indicates that the following statements are configuring a package.

The last line, `[dependencies]`, is the start of a section for you to list any of your projectâ€™s dependencies. In Rust, packages of code are referred to as [[crate]]s.
