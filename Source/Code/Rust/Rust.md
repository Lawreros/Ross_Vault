# Rust
Rust is a multi-paradigm programming language designed for performance and safety, especially safe [[concurrency]]. Rust is syntactically similar to C++, but can guarantee memory safety by using a borrow checker to validate references. Rust was originally designed by Graydon Hoare at Mozilla Research, with contributions from Dave Herman, Brendan Eich, and others.
