#### Data Types:
Every value in [[Rust]] is of a certain _data type_, which tells Rust what kind of data is being specified so it knows how to work with that data. Weâ€™ll look at two data type subsets: scalar and compound.

Keep in mind that Rust is a _statically typed_ language, which means that it must know the types of all variables at compile time.

##### Scalar Types:
A *scalar* type represents a single value:
- [[integer (Rust)]]
- [[floating-point (Rust)]]
- [[numeric operation (Rust)]]
- [[boolean (Rust)]]
- [[character (Rust)]]

##### Compound Types:
*Compound types* can group multiple values into one type. Rust has two primitive compound types.
- [[tuple (Rust)]]
- [[array (Rust)]]
