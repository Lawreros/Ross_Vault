- Heading South on 84 at approximately 13:02
- There had been an accident so all cars were being directed onto exit 4 to South St. Paul Street
- At the intersection of St. Paul and Mt. Royal, took a left turn onto Mt. Royal while having a green light. There were two cars immediately ahead of me turning right.
- Heard passenger (Alex Loftus) shouting to "look out" and turned to see the car just as it was about to hit
- Other car either going west on Mt. Royal or south on St. Paul hit back left bumper of my car. Other car was a minivan with champagne colored paint.
- Stopped in the intersection for 5-10 seconds before pulling over in front of 100 East Mt Royal Street
- Other car pulled over behind me and parked
- heard white officer talking on radio that the accident wasn't a big deal (didn't hear specifics, but sentiment was that it wasn't a big deal)
- Police car stationed at bp gas station on the corner of the intersection drives over and two officers get out (one Caucasian male, approx 5'10'' with brown hair, and the other African American male, approx 6'1'' with shaved head) and ask for license and information
- They handed Gary's insurance and license to me, and I handed my insurance and license to him. We each took pictures of the information.
- Gary's passenger was talking to the Caucasian cop and said that I was "trying to sneak out on the yellow". The officer responded that would mean I had the right of way, as Gary's car would have had the red at the time.
- No ticket or citation was given, with the officers saying that they "do not get involved with insurance claims" and "this would be hashed out by insurance".
- Was handed back my information by the African American cop and told that I could leave.
- Left the scene and went home.
