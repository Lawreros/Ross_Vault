###### Content:
The transpose of a [[matrix]] $A$, denoted $A^t$, is the matrix obtained from $A$ by interchanging the rows and columns. More specifically, if $A$ is an *m*-by-*n* matrix, then $A^t$ is the *n*-by-*m* matrix whose entries are given by the equation $$(A^t)_{k,j} = A_{j,k}$$

###### Properties:
- The transpose of the product of matrices. If $A$ is an *m*-by-*n* matrix and $\textit{C}$ is an *n*-by-*p* matrix, then $$(AC)^t=C^tA^t$$
