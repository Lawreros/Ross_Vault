###### Content:
A general method for multiplying algebaric expressions using the distributive law. (not really important aside from what it means for L2 norms, but feel free to google it)

###### Properties:
- The foil method is useful when dealing with [[L2 norm]]s. As the FOIL rule with column vectors $u,v \in \mathbb{R}^n$ tells us that: $$||u-v||^2 = (u-b)^T(u-v)$$ $$=u^tu-u^tv-v^Tu+v^Tv$$ $$=||u||^2-2u^Tv+||v||^2$$ allowing for the expanding and altering of the norm
