###### Content:
The general linear group of degree $n$ is the set of $n\times n$ [[invertible matrix]]es, together with the operation of [[matrix multiplication]]. This forms a group, because the product of two invertible matricies is again invertible, and the inverse of an invertible matrix is invertible, with identity matrix as the identity element of the group.

The [[nonsingular]] matrices in $M_n(\textbf{F})$ form a group often denoted by $GL(n,\textbf{F})$
