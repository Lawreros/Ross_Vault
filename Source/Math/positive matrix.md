###### Content:
The matrix $A \in M_{m,n}(\mathbb{R})$ is considered a positive matrix if every entry in the matrix is real and greater than 0. This is denoted as: $$A > 0$$

###### Properties:
- If $A\in M_n$ is a positive matrix, then the [[spectral radius]] $\rho(A) >0$
- Suppose $A \in M_n$ is a positive matrix, and the vector $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$ is a positive vector (no entries $\leq 0$). If there exists some $\alpha \geq 0$ such that $Ax > \alpha x$, then $\rho(A) > \alpha$. If there exists some $\alpha \geq 0$ such that $Ax < \alpha x$, then $\rho(A) < \alpha$.
