###### Content:
Any [[Jordan block]] is the sum of a [[diagonal matrix]] and a [[nilpotent matrix]]. Thus, any square complex matrix is a sum of two commuting matrices, one of which is [[diagonalizable]] and the other of which is a [[nilpotent matrix]].

If $A \in M_n$ and $A = SJ_AS^{-1}$ is its Jordan canonical form, then $A = S(D+N)S^{-1}=SDS^{-1}+SNS^{-1}=A_D+A_N$, in which $A_D$ is [[diagonalizable]] and $A_N$ is a [[nilpotent matrix]]. Thus all matrices are [[similar]] to a Jordan decomposition.

###### Properties:
- The Jordan decomposition is unique.
