###### Content:
A set of matrices is said to be simultaneously [[diagonalizable]] if there exists a single [[invertible matrix]] $S$ such that $S^{-1}AS$ is a [[diagonal matrix]] for every $A$ in the set.

In other words, if for the same $S$:
$$A = SD_1S^{-1}$$
$$B=SD_2S^{-1}$$
Then $A$ and $B$ are said to be simultaneously diagonalizable.

###### Properties:
- A set of [[diagonalizable]] matrices commutes ([[commutativity]]) if an only if the set is simultaneously diagonalizable.
