###### Content:
A matrix $A \in M_n$ is diagonally dominant if, $\forall i$, $|a_{ii}| \geq \sum_{j\neq i1}|a_{ij}|$. In other words, if for each row of the matrix, if the diagonal value is greater than or *equal to* the sum of the other entries in the row, then the matrix is diagonally dominant. This is different from [[strictly diagonally dominant]], which excludes the equality.

You can also say that individual rows in a matrix are diagonally dominant.
