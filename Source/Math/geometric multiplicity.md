###### Content:
Let $A \in M_n$ and let $\lambda$ be an [[eigenvalue]] of $A$. The [[dimension]] of the [[eigenspace]] of $A$ associated with $\lambda$ is its geometric multiplicity of $\lambda$.

**Examples:**
$$A_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$$ For $\lambda = 1$, [[geometric multiplicity]] = 1, [[algebraic multiplicity]] = 1
For $\lambda = 2$, [[geometric multiplicity]] = 1, [[algebraic multiplicity]] = 1

$$A_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$ For $\lambda = 1$, [[geometric multiplicity]] = 1, [[algebraic multiplicity]] = 2

###### Properties:
- Since the geometric multiplicity is the dimension of the [[null space]] of $A-\lambda I$, it is equal to $n-rank(A-\lambda I)$. It is also the maximum number of [[linearly independent]] [[eigenvector]]s associated with $\lambda$.
