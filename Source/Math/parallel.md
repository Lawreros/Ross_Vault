###### Content:
For $v \in V$ and $U$ a subspace of $V$, the [[affine subset]] $v+U$ is said to be **parallel** to $U$.

###### Properties:


###### Additional Thoughts:
- Think of this as $U$ being a flat plane and adding the vector $v$ to every point in $U$. So, if $v = (1,0)$, then $v+U$ effectively shifts the plane of $U$ 1 along the x-axis (thus making it parallel to where it used to be)
