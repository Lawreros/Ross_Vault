###### Content:
A [[square matrix]] $A\in M_n$ is nonderogatory when for all of its [[eigenvalue]]s there is only one associated [[Jordan block]]:
i.e. each of its [[eigenvalue]]s has [[geometric multiplicity]] 1.
i.e. its [[characteristic polynomial]] and [[minimal polynomial]] are the same ($q_A = p_A$)

Note, this is different from [[nondefective]] as the [[algebraic multiplicity]] of an eigenvalue can be any value, as long as the geometric multiplicity is 1.

###### Properties:
- Suppose that $A \in M_n$ is nonderogatory. If $B \in M_n$ commutes with $A$, then there is a [[polynomial]] $p(t)$ with the [[degree of a polynomial]] being at most $n-1$ such that $B = p(A)$.
- $A \in M_n$ is [[diagonalizable]] and nonderogatory if and only if the [[characteristic polynomial]] is the product of distinct linear factors (i.e. $(t-\lambda)$ ).
- Let $A,B,S \in M_n$ be given and suppose that $A$ is nonderogatory. If $AB = BA^T$, then $B$ is [[symmetric]]. If $S$ is [[nonsingular]] and $A^T=S^{-1}AS$, then $S$ is symmetric.
