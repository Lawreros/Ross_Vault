###### Content:
A [[polynomial]] $p(t)$ is said to annihilate $A \in M_n$ if $p(A)=0$.

**Example:**
$A^2 = -3A +2I$ can be changed into the annihilating polynomial: $$p(t) = t^2+3t+2$$
$$p(A) = 0 = (A+1I)(A+2I)$$


###### Properties:
- For every annihilating polynomial there exists a unique [[monic polynomial]], $q_A(t)$, called the [[minimal polynomial]] which divides $p(t)$. Thus $p(A) = 0$ and $p(t) = h(t)q_A(T)$ for some monic polynomial $h(t)$.
- Let $A \in M_n$, and let $p(t)$ be any [[polynomial]]. You can say that $p(t)$ annihilates $A$ if and only if the [[minimal polynomial]] $q_A(t)$ divides $p(t)$. (i.e. there exists some $d(t)$ such that $p(t)=d(t)q_A(t)$)
