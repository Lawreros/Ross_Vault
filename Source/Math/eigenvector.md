###### Content:
Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and $\lambda \in \textbf{F}$ is and [[eigenvalue]]of $T$. A vector $v \in V$ is called an eigenvector of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda$ if $v \neq 0$ and $Tv = \lambda v$

###### Properties:
- [[linearly independent]] eigenvectors. Let $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Suppose $\lambda_1,...,\lambda_m$ are distinct [[eigenvalue]]s of $T$ and $v_1,...,v_m$ are corresponding eigenvectors. Then $v_1,...,v_m$ is linearly independent.
- If all the [[eigenvalue]]s of a [[matrix]] are distinct, then their corresponding eigenvectors [[span]] the space of column vectors to which the columns of the matrix belong.
