###### Content:
For $T$ a function from $V$ to $W$, the range of $T$ is the subset of $W$ consisting of those vectors that are of the form $Tv$ for some $v \in V$:
$$\text{range}T = \{Tv : v \in V\}$$

###### Properties:
- If $T$ is the zero map from $V$ to $W$, in other words if $Tv = 0$ for every $v \in V$, then range $T = \{0\}$.
- If $T \in \mathcal{L}(V,W)$, then range $T$ is a [[subspace]] of $W$.
- Due to [[Fundamental Theorem of Linear Maps]], a map to a smaller dimensional space is not injective:
		- Suppose $V$ and $W$ are [[finite-dimensional vector space]]s such that dim $V$ > dim $W$. Then no [[linear map]] from $V$ to $W$ is [[injective]]
