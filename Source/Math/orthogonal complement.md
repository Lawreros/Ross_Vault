###### Content:
If $U$ is a [[subset]] of [[inner product space]] $V$, then the orthogonal complement of $U$, denoted $U^\perp$, is the set of all vectors in $V$ that are [[orthogonal]] to every vector in $U$: $$U^\perp = \{v \in V: \langle v,u \rangle = 0 \text{ for every } u \in U\}$$

**Basic properties of orthogonal complement**
(a) If $U$ is a subset of $V$, then $U^\perp$ is a [[subspace]] of $V$.
(b) $\{0\}^\perp = V$
(c) $V^\perp = \{0\}$
(d) If $U$ is a subset of $V$, then $U \cap U^\perp \subset \{0\}$
(e) If $U$ and $W$ are subsets of $V$ and $U \subset W$, then $W^\perp \subset U^\perp$

###### Properties:
- [[direct sum]] of a subspace and its orthogonal complement. Suppose $U$ is a finite-dimensional subspace of $V$. Then $V = U \oplus U^\perp$.
- [[dimension]] of the orthogonal complement. Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a subspace of $V$. Then $\text{dim }U^\perp = \text{dim }V - \text{dim }U$.
- The orthogonal complement of the orthogonal complement. Suppose $U$ is a [[finite-dimensional subspace]] of $V$. Then $U  = (U^\perp)^\perp$.
