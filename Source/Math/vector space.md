A vector space is a set $V$ along with an addition on $V$ and a scalar multiplication on $V$ such that the following properties hold:
- [[commutativity]]
- [[associativity]]
- [[additive identity]]
- [[additive inverse]]
- [[multiplicative identity]]
- [[distributive property]]

###### Properties:
- A vector space over **R** is called a [[real vector space]]
- A vector space over **C** is called a [[complex vector space]]
- A vector space has a unique [[additive identity]]
- Every element in a vector space has a unique [[additive inverse]]
- column rank
