###### Content:
The null hypothesis (often denoted $H_0$) is that two possibilities are the same. The null hypothesis is that the observed difference is due to chance alone. Using statistical tests, it is possible to calculate the likelihood that the null hypothesis is true.

**Example:**
Given the test scores of two random samples, on of men and one of women, does one group differ from the other? A possible null hypothesis is that the mean male score is the same as the mean female score:
$$H_0 : \mu_1 = \mu_2$$
where $H_0$ is the null hypothesis, $\mu_1$ is the mean of the men's scores, and $\mu_2$ is the mean of the female's scores.
A stronger null hypothesis is that the two samples are drawn from the same population, such that the [[variance]]s and shapes of the distributions are also equal.

###### Properties:
- The statement that is being tested against the null hypothesis is the [[alternate hypothesis]] (often denoted $H_1$ or $H_A$)
