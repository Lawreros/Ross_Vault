###### Content:
With respect to combinatorics, the binomial coefficient calculates the number of ways to choose and unordered subset of $k$ elements from a fixed set of $n$ elements (read as "$n$ choose $k$").
Let $n$ and $k$ be nonnegative integers with $0 \leq k \leq n$. The number of distinct subsets of size $k$ that a set of size $n$ has is given by the binomial coefficient: $${n \choose k} = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}$$
