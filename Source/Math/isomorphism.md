###### Content:
If $U$ and $V$ are [[vector space]]s over the same scalar [[field]] $F$ and if the function $f = U \rightarrow V$ is an [[invertible]] function such that $f(ax=by)=af(x)+bf(y)$ for all $x,y \in U$ and all $a,b \in F$, then $f$ is said to be an isomorphism. $U$ and $V$ are said to be [[isomorphic]].

**Note:**  The function $f$ can be considered to be a [[linear map]] or [[linear functional]] if you want to look at things with respect to matrices.

###### Properties:
- Two [[finite-dimensional vector space]]s over the same field are isomorphic if and only if they have the same dimension. Thus any $n$-dimensional vector space is isomorphic to $F^n$.
