###### Content:
An [[operator]] $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is called self-adjoint if $T = T^*$. In other words, $T\in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is self-adjoint if and only if: $$\langle Tv, w \rangle = \langle v, Tw \rangle$$ for all $v,w\in V$

###### Properties:
- Every [[eigenvalue]] of a self-adjoint operator is real.
- Over $\textbf{C}, Tv$ is [[orthogonal]] to $v$ for all $v$ only for the 0 operator. Suppose $V$ is a complex [[inner product space]] and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Suppose $\langle Tv, v \rangle = 0$ for all $v \in V$. Then $T=0$.
- Over $\textbf{C}, \langle Tv, v \rangle$ is real for all $v$ only for self-adjoint operators. Suppose $V$ is a complex inner product space and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Then $T$ is self-adjoint if and only if $\langle Tv, v \rangle \in \textbf{R}$ for every $v \in V$
- If $T = T^*$ and $\langle Tv, v \rangle = 0$ for all $v$, then $T = 0$. Suppose $T$ is a self-adjoint operator on $V$ such that $\langle Tv,v \rangle = 0$ for all $v \in V$. Then $T = 0$.
