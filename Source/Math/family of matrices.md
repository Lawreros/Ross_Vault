###### Content:
A family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq M_n$ of matrices is a nonempty finite or infinite set of matrices.

###### Properties:
- A family $\mathcal{F} \subset M_n$ is said to be [[simultaneously diagonalizable]] if there is a single [[nonsingular]] $S \in M_n$ such that $S^{-1}AS$ is [[diagonal]] for every $A \in \mathcal{F}$
