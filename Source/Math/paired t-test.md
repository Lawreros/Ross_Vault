###### Content:
The correlated t-test, or paired t-test, is a dependent type of test and is performed when the samples consist of matched pairs of similar units, or when there are cases of repeated measures. For example, there may be instances where the same patients are repeatedly tested before and after receiving a particular treatment. Each patient is being used as a control sample against themselves.

The formula for computing the [[t-value]] and [[degrees of freedom]] for a paired t-test:

$$T = \frac{\mu_1 - \mu_2}{\frac{\sigma(diff)}{\sqrt{n}}}$$
where $\mu_1$ and $\mu_2$ are the average values of each of the sample sets, $\sigma(diff)$ is the [[standard deviation]] of the differences of the paired data values, $n$ is the sample size (the number of paired differences), and $n-1$ is the [[degrees of freedom]].


###### Properties:
- This method also applies to cases where the samples are related or have matching characteristics, like a comparative analysis involving children, parents, or siblings.
