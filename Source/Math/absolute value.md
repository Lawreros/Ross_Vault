###### Content:
The absolute value of [[complex numbers]] $z$, denoted $|z|$, is defined by $|z| = \sqrt{(Re z)^2 + (Im z)^2}$
It can also be defined as the distance from a point in [[vector space]] to the origin. For a given vector $a = (a_1,a_2,...,a_n)$, the absolute value/modulus is found with the [[Euclidean distance]]:
$$|a| = \sqrt{a_1^2+a_2^2+...+a_n^2}$$
