###### Content:
If $A \in M_n$ is a [[positive matrix]], then the following are true:
1) $\rho(A) >0$
2) $\rho(A)$ is an [[eigenvalue]] of $A$
3) There exists some vector $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, where each entry of $x$ is greater than 0, such that $Ax = \rho(A)x$
4) The [[algebraic multiplicity]] of $\rho(A)$ is 1
5) For all $\lambda \in \sigma(A)$  ([[spectrum]]) such that $\lambda \neq \rho(A)$, the inequality $|\lambda| \in \rho(A)$ holds.

###### Properties:
- If $A >0$, there exists a unique positive vector $x>0, ||x||_1=1$ such that $Ax = \rho(A)x$. This is called the "Perron Vector"
