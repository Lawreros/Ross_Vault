Complex numbers were invented so that we can take square roots of negative numbers. The idea is to assume we have a square root of -1, denoted $i$, that obeys the usual rules of arithmetic.

Suppose $z = a+bi$, where $a$ and $b$ are real numbers:
- The **real part** of $z$, denoted Re $z$, is defined by Re $z=a$
- The **imaginary part** of $z$, denoted Im $z$, is defined by Im $z = b$

**Definition:**
- A ***complex number*** is an ordered pair $(a,b)$, where $a,b \in \textbf{R}$, but we will write this as $a+bi$
- The set of all complex numbers is denoted by **C**: $$\textbf{C} = \{a+bi : a,b \in \textbf{R}\}$$
- ***Addition and multiplication*** on **C** are defined by: $$(a+bi) + (c+di) = (a+c)+(b+c)i$$ $$(a+bi)(c+di) = (ac-bd) + (ad + bc)i$$ here $a,b,c,d \in \textbf{R}$
- ***Subtraction and division*** on **C** are defined by: $$b - a = b+(-a)$$ $$b/a = b(1/a)$$ here $a,b \in \textbf{R}$

**Properties:**
By definition, complex numbers have the following properties:
- [[commutativity]]
- [[associativity]]
- [[additive identity]]
- [[multiplicative identity]]
- [[additive inverse]]
- [[multiplicative inverse]]
- [[distributive property]]

Suppose $w,z \in \textbf{C}$. Then:
-	$z+\bar z = 2$ Re $z$
-	$z - \bar z = 2($Im $z)i$
-	$z\bar z = |z|^2$
- $\overline{w+z} = \bar w + \bar z$ and $\overline{wz} = \bar w \bar z$
- $\bar{\bar{z}} = z$ ([[complex conjugate]] of complex conjugate)
- |Re $z$| $\leq |z|$ and |Im $z$| $\leq |z|$
- $|\bar z| = |z|$
- $|wz| = |w||z|$
- $|w+z| \leq |w|+|z|$
