###### Content:
Events where it is impossible for them to occur together. The probability of the union of mutually exclusive events is equal to the sum of their probabilities.
If $A_1, A_2, ..., A_n$ are pairwise disjoint events then: $$P(A_i \cup ... \cup A_n) = P(A_1)+...+P(A_n)$$
$$P(A_i \cap ... \cap A_n) = \emptyset$$

###### Properties:
