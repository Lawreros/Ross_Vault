###### Content:
The Frobenius norm is a [[matrix norm]] of an $m\times n$ matrix $A$ defined as the square root of the sum of the absolute squares of its elements:
$$||A||_F = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^m \sum_{j=1}^m |a_{i,j}|^2}$$
And can also be considered as a [[vector norm]]. It is also equal to the matrix [[trace]] of $AA^*$ where $A^*$ is it's [[conjugate transpose]]
$$||A||_F = \sqrt{trace(AA^*)}$$

###### Properties:
- Let $A,B \in M_n$ be [[unitarily similar]]. Then $$\sqrt{\sum_{i,j=1}^n |a_{ij}|^2} = ||A||_F = ||B||_F$$
