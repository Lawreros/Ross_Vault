###### Content:
Suppose $V$ is an [[inner product space]]. Two vectors $u,v \in V$ are called orthogonal if $\langle u ,v \rangle = 0$.

Two [[matrix]]es are said to be orthogonal if $A^TA = I$

###### Properties:
- Orthogonality and 0. 0 is orthogonal to every vector in $V$ and is the only vector in $V$ that is orthogonal to itself
