Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. A number $\lambda \in \textbf{F}$ is called an eigenvalue of $T$ if there exists $v \in V$ such that $v \neq 0$ and $Tv = \lambda v$

###### Properties:
- Equivalent conditions to be an eigenvalue. Suppose $V$ is a [[finite-dimensional vector space]]. $T\in \mathcal{L}(V)$, and $\lambda \in \textbf{F}$. Then the following are equivalent:
		- $\lambda$ is an eigenvalue of $T$
		- $T-\lambda I$ is not [[injective]]
		- $T - \lambda I$ is not [[surjective]]
		- $T - \lambda I$ is not [[invertible]]
- Number of eigenvalues. Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then each [[operator]] on $V$ has at most dim $V$ distinct eigenvalues
- Let $\lambda_1, ...,\lambda_k$ be $k \geq 2$ distinct eigenvalues of $A\in M_n$ (that is, $\lambda_i \neq \lambda_j$ if $i \neq j$ and $1 \leq i, j\leq k$), and suppose that $x^{(i)}$ is an [[eigenvector]] associated with $\lambda_i$ for each $i = 1,...,k$. Then the vectors $x^{(1)},...,x^{(k)}$ are [[linearly independent]]
- Enough eigenvalues implies diagonalizability. If $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ has dim $V$ distinct eigenvalues, then $T$ is [[diagonalizable]]
