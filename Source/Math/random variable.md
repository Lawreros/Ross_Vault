###### Content:
A random variable is a function from a [[sample space]] $\Omega$ to a measurable space of real numbers ( $X:\Omega \rightarrow E$). A random variable is often denoted by capital roman letters, such as $X,Y,Z,T$.  When the range of a random variable $X$ is countable, the random variable is called a [[discrete random variable]]. When the range is not countable, it is a [[continuous random variable]].

###### Properties:
- A random variable $X$ is **degenerate** if there is some real value $b$ such that $P(X = b)=1$. A degenerate random variable has zero [[variance]]
- The **median** of a random variable $X$ is any real value $m$ that satisfies $$P(X \geq m) \geq \frac{1}{2} \text{  and  } P(X\leq m) \geq \frac{1}{2}$$
- For $0<p<1$, the **pth quantile** of a random variable $X$ is any real value $x$ satisfying $$P(X \geq x) \geq 1-p \text{  and  } P(X\leq x) \geq p$$
