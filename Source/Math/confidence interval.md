###### Content:
A confidence interval is the mean of your estimate plus and minus the variation in that estimate. This is the range of values you expect your estimate to fall between if you redo your test, within a certain level of confidence.

Confidence, in statistics, is another way to describe probability. For example, if you construct a confidence interval with a $95\%$ confidence level, you are confident with 95 out of 100 times the estimate will fall between the upper and lower values specified by the confidence interval.
Your desired confidence level is usually one minus the alpha ($\alpha$) value you use in your statistical test:
$$\text{Confidence level} = 1-\alpha$$
