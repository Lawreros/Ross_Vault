###### Content:
Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and $\lambda \in \textbf{F}$. The eigenspace of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda$, denoted $E(\lambda,T)$, is defined by $$E(\lambda,T) = null(T-\lambda I)$$ In other words, $E(\lambda, T)$ is the set of all [[eigenvector]]s of $T$ corresponding to $\lambda$, along with the 0 vector.

###### Properties:
- For $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ and $\lambda \in \textbf{F}$, the eigenspace $E(\lambda,T)$ is a [[subspace]] of $V$ (because the null space of each linear map on $V$ is a subspace of $V$).

- Sum of eigenspaces is a [[direct sum]]. Suppose $V$ is finite [[dimension]]al and $T\in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Suppose also that $\lambda_1,...,\lambda_m$ are distinct [[eigenvalue]]s of $T$. Then $$E(\lambda_1,T)+...+E(\lambda_m,T)$$ is a direct sum. Furthermore, $$dimE(\lambda_1,T)+...+dim E(\lambda_m,T) \leq dim V$$
