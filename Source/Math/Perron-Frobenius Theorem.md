###### Content:
If $A \in M_n$ is a [[nonnegative matrix]] and [[irreducible]], then the following are true:
1) $\rho(A) >0$
2) $\rho(A)$ is an [[eigenvalue]] of $A$
3) There exists some vector $x \in \mathbb{C}^n$, where each entry of $x$ is greater than 0, such that $Ax = \rho(A)x$
4) The [[algebraic multiplicity]] of $\rho(A)$ is 1

*Note that this is very similar to the [[Perron Theorem]], but without the 5th property*
