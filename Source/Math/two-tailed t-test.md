###### Content:
A two-tailed t-test is used if the mean of one group is expected to be greater or less than the mean of the other group. Using the [[Student's t-distribution]] and [[degrees of freedom]], [[statistical significance]] can be calculate by seeing if the [[t-value]] falls above or below the two-sided critical value. This is done by calculating the [[t-value]] and comparing it to a table of values (see Properties) for the different probabilities

This method is mainly used when you do not care about the direction of the difference between the means of both groups.
