###### Content:
A basis of $V$ is a list of vectors in $V$ that is [[linearly independent]] and [[span]]s $V$.
A list of $v_1,...,v_n$ of vectors in $V$ is a basis of $V$ if and only if every $v \in V$ can be written uniquely in the form:
$$v = a_1v_1+...+a_nv_n$$
where $a_1,...,a_n \in \textbf{F}$.

###### Properties:
- A spanning list in a [[vector space]] may not be a basis because it is not [[linearly independent]]
- Every spanning list in a [[vector space]] can be reduced to a basis of the vector space
- Every [[finite-dimensional vector space]] has a basis
- Every [[linearly independent]] list of vectors in a [[finite-dimensional vector space]] can be extended to a basis of the [[vector space]]
	- Every [[subspace]] of $V$ is part of a [[direct sum]] equal to $V$. Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a subspace of $V$. Then there is a subspace $W$ of $V$ such that $V = U \bigoplus W$.
- Any two bases of a finite-dimensional vector space have the same number of vectors (length)
