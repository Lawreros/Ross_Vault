###### Content:
Used when testing the [[null hypothesis]] that a population mean is equal to a specified value $\mu_0$ (i.e. is the mean of this group $\mu_0$). The [[t-value]] is calculated as:

$$t = \frac{\bar x - \mu_0}{s/\sqrt{n}}$$
where $\bar x$ is the sample mean, $s$ is the sample [[standard deviation]] and $n$ is the sample size. The [[degrees of freedom]] used in this test are $n-1$. Although the parent population does not need to be normally distributed, the distribution of the population of sample means $\bar {x}$ is assumed to have a [[normal distribution]].

The calculated [[t-value]] can be used to carry out either a [[one-tailed t-test]] or [[two-tailed t-test]].

###### Properties:
- By the [[central limit theorem]], if the observations are [[independent]] and the second [[moment]] exists, then $t$ will be approximately normal $N(0,1)$
