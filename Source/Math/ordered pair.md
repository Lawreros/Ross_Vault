An ordered pair $(a,b)$ is a pair of objects (events, if dealing with probabilities). The order in which the objects appear in the ordered pair is significant, meaning $(a,b)$ is different from $(b,a)$

**Example:**
The outcome of two dice being rolled, where die 1 is a 6 and die 2 is a 5 would be represented as: $(6,5)$
