###### Content:
In statistical hypothesis testing, a result has statistical significance when it is very unlikely to have occurred given the [[null hypothesis]] (simply by chance alone). More precisely, a study's defined significance level, denoted by $\alpha$, is the probability of the study rejecting the null hypothesis, given that the null hypothesis is true; and the [[p-value]] of a result, $p$, is the probability of obtaining a result at least as extreme, given that the null hypothesis is true.
The result is statistically significant, by the standards of the study, when $p\leq \alpha$

###### Properties:
- The significance level for a study is chosen before data collection, and is typically set to 5% or much lowerâ€”depending on the field of study.
