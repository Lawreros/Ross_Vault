###### Content:
A list of length $n$ is an **ordered** collection of $n$ elements (which might be numbers, other lists, or more abstract entites) separated by commas and surrounded by parentheses. A list of length $n$ looks like this: $$(x_1,...,x_n)$$

###### Properties:
- Differ from a [[set]] in two ways: in a list order matters and repetitions have meaning; in a set, order and repetitions are irrelevant.
- Two lists are equal if and only if they have the same length and the same elements in the same order.
- Each list has a finite length that is a nonnegative number. An object that looks like $(x_1,x_2,...)$ which might be said to have infinite length, is not a list.
- A list of length 0 looks like this: $()$
