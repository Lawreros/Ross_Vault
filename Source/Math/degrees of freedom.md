###### Content:
Degrees of freedom refers to the maximum number of logically [[independent]] values, which are values that have the freedom to vary, in the data sample. It is usually calculated by subtracting one from the number of items within the data sample. It is always minus one because, if there are parameters placed on the data set, the last data item must be very specific to make sure all other points conform to that outcome.

**Examples:**
1.  Consider a data sample consisting of five positive integers. The values of the five integers must have an average of six. If four of the items within the data set are {3, 8, 5, and 4}, the fifth number must be 10. Because the first four numbers can be chosen at random, the degrees of freedom is four.
2. Consider a data sample consisting of five positive integers. The values could be any number with no known relationship between them. Because all five numbers can be chosen at random with no limitations, the degrees of freedom is four.
3. Consider a data sample consisting of one integer. That integer must be odd. Because there are constraints on the single item within the data set, the degrees of freedom is zero.

###### Properties:
- Degrees of freedom are commonly used in relation to various forms of hypothesis testing in statistics, such as the validity of the [[null hypothesis]]
- Some calculations of degrees of freedom with multiple number of parameters or relationships use the formula $Df = N - P$, where $P$ is the number of different parameters or relationships. For example, in a [[two-sample t-test]], $N - 2$ is used because there are two parameters to estimate.
