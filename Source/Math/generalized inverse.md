Let $A \in M_{m,n}$ and $C \subseteq \{1,2,3,4\}$. The matrix $B \in M_{n,m}$ is called the $C$-generalized inverse of $A$ if:
1) $ABA=A$
2) $AB$ is [[Hermitian]]
3) $BAB=B$
4) $BA$ is [[Hermitian]]

###### Properties:
- Let $A \in M_{m,n}$ and $b\in \mathbb{C}^m$ be given, and suppose that $B\in M_{n,m}$ is a 1-generalized inverse of $A$. If the linear system $Ax = b$ has a solution then $Bb$ is a solution.
