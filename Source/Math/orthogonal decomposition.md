###### Content:
The orthogonal decomposition of a vector $y$ in $\textbf{R}^n$ is the sum of a vector in a subspace $W$ of $\textbf{R}^n$ and a vector in the [[orthogonal complement]] $W^{\perp}$ to $W$. I.e. you break a vector down into orthogonal components (think a right triangle, adding both sides to make the hypotenuse).

**Example**
Suppose $u,v \in V$, where $V$ is a [[inner product space]] and $v \neq 0$. Set $c = \frac{\langle u,v \rangle}{||v||^2}$ and $w = u - \frac{\langle u,v \rangle}{||v||^2}v$. Then $\langle w, v \rangle = 0$ and $u = cv+w$
