###### Content:
A set is the mathematical model for a collection of different things; a set contains elements or members, which can be mathematical objects of any kind: numbers, symbols, points in space, lines, other geometrical shapes, variables, or even other sets.

- A set may have a finite number of elements or be an infinite set. 
- Two sets are equal if they have precisely the same elements.
