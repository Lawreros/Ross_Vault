###### Content:
Suppose $A$ is an *m*-by-*n* [[matrix]] with entries in $\textbf{F}$. The column rank of $A$ is the [[dimension]] of the [[span]] of the columns of $A$ in $\textbf{F}^{m,1}$

###### Properties:
- [[row rank]] is equal to column rank. Suppose $A \in \textbf{F}^{m,n}$. Then the row rank of $A$ equals the column rank of $A$.

- [[dimension]] of [[range]] $T$ equals [[column rank]] of $\mathcal{M}(T)$. Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-dimensional and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V,W)$. Then dim range $T$ equals the column rank of $\mathcal{M}(T)$ ([[matrix of a linear map]])
