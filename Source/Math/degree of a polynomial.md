###### Content:
A polynomial $p \in \mathcal{P}(\textbf{F})$ is said to have degree $m$ if there exist scalars $a_0,a_1,...,a_m \in \textbf{F}$ with $a_m \neq 0$ such that:
$$p(z) = a_0+a_1z+...+a_mz^m$$
for all $z \in \textbf{F}$. If $p$ has degree $m$, we write deg $p = m$

###### Properties:
- The polynomial that is identically 0 is said to have degree $-\infty$
- $\mathcal{P}_m(\textbf{F})$ denotes the set of all polynomials with coefficients in **F** and degree at most $m$
