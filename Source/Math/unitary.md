###### Content:
 $A \in M_{n}(\textbf{F})$ is said to be unitary if $A^*A = I$

###### Properties:
- If $U, V \in M_n$ are unitary (respectively, [[real orthogonal]]), then $UV$ is also unitary (respectively, [[real orthogonal]])
- The set of unitary (respectively, real orthogonal) matrices in $M_n$ forms a group. This group is generally referred to as the $n$-by-$n$ unitary (respectively, real orthogonal) group, a subgroup of [[general linear group]] $GL(n,\textbf{C})$
