###### Content:
The dimension of a [[finite-dimensional vector space]] is the number of vectors (length) of any [[basis]] of the [[vector space]]. The dimension of $V$ (if $V$ is finite-dimensional) is denoted by dim $V$.

###### Properties:
- If $V$ is finite-dimensional and $U$ is a [[subspace]] of $V$, then dim $U$ $\leq$ dim $V$
- Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then every [[linearly independent]] list of vectors in $V$ with length dim $V$ is a [[basis]] of $V$.
- Suppose $V$ is finite-dimensional. Then every [[span]]ning list of vectors in $V$ with length dim $V$ is a [[basis]] of $V$.
- If $U_1$ and $U_2$ are [[subspace]]s of a [[finite-dimensional vector space]], then $dim(U_1 + U_2) = dim U_1 + dim U_2 - dim(U_1 \bigcap U_2)$
