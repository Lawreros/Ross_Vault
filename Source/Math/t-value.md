###### Content:
The result of a [[t-test]], the t-value (or t-score) is a ratio of the difference between the mean of the two sample sets and the [[variance]] that exists within the sample sets. The equation to calculate it is a fraction where the numerator value is the difference between the mean of the two sample sets. The denominator is the variation that exists within the sample sets and is a measurement of the dispersion or variability.

This calculated t-value is then compared against a value obtained from a critical value table called the T-distribution table. Higher values of the t-score indicate that a large difference exists between the two sample sets. The smaller the t-value, the more similarity exists between the two sample sets.

###### Properties:
- A large t-score indicates that the groups are different while a small t-score indicates that the groups are similar.
- See [[t-test]] for the different types and their associated equations for calculating t-values
