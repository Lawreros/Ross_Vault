###### Content:
The dual space of $V$, denoted $V'$, is the [[vector space]] of all [[linear functional]]s on $V$. In other words, $V' = \mathcal{L}(V,\textbf{F})$.

###### Properties:
-  Suppose $V$ is a [[finite-dimensional vector space]]. Then $V'$ is also a [[finite-dimensional vector space]] and $dim V' = dim V$.
-  A basis of a dual space is called a [[dual basis]]
