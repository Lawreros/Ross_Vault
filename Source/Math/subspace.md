###### Content:
A subset $U$ of $V$ is called a subspace of $V$ if $U$ is also a [[vector space]] (having the same required addition and scalar multiplication properties).

An easy way to check whether a subset of a [[vector space]] is a subspace is to check the following:
- [[additive identity]]
- [[closed under addition]]
- [[closed under scalar multiplication]]

###### Properties:
- An empty subset cannot be a subspace due to its lacking of an additive identity
- An intersection of subspaces is always a subspace
- A union of subspaces need not be a subspace.
- The subspaces of $\textbf{R}^2$ are precisely {0}, $\textbf{R}^2$, and all lines in $\textbf{R}^2$ through the origin. The subspaces of $\textbf{R}^3$ are precisely {0}, $\textbf{R}^3$, and all lines in $\textbf{R}^3$ through the origin
