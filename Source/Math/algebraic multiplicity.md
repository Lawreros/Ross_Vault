###### Content:
Let $A \in M_n$ and let $\lambda$ be an [[eigenvalue]] of $A$. The multiplicity of $\lambda$ as a zero of the [[characteristic polynomial]] of $A$ is the algebraic multiplicity of $\lambda$.

In other words, how many times does the eigenvalue appear in the characteristic polynomial or along the diagonal of the [[upper-triangular matrix]].

**Examples:**
$$A_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 2 \end{bmatrix}$$ For $\lambda = 1$, [[geometric multiplicity]] = 1, [[algebraic multiplicity]] = 1
For $\lambda = 2$, [[geometric multiplicity]] = 1, [[algebraic multiplicity]] = 1

$$A_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix}$$ For $\lambda = 1$, [[geometric multiplicity]] = 1, [[algebraic multiplicity]] = 2
