###### Content:
The [[matrix norm]] $||\cdot||$ on $M_n$ is compatible with the [[vector norm]] $||\cdot||'$ on $\mathbb{C}^n$ if, for all $A \in M_n, x \in \mathbb{C}^n$: $$||Ax||' \leq ||A||||x||'$$

*Note: This is not submultiplicative because $A$ is a matrix and $x$ is a vector*

###### Properties:
- If the matrix norm $||\cdot||$ is induced by $||\cdot||'$ then they are compatible by definition.
