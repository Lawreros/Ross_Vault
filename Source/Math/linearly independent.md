###### Content:
A list $v_1,...,v_m$ of vectors in $V$ is called linearly independent if the only choice of $a_1,...,a_m \in \textbf{F}$ that makes $a_1v_1+...+a_mv_m$ equal 0 is $a_1 = ... = a_m = 0$

###### Properties:
- The empty list ( ) is also declared to be linearly independent
- Length of linearly independent list $\leq$ length of [[span]]ing list
	- In [[finite-dimensional vector space]], the length of every linearly independent list of vectors is less than or equal to the length of every [[span]]ing list of vectors.
