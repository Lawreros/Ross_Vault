###### Content:
A linear map $T \in \mathcal{L}(V,W)$ is called invertible if there exists a [[linear map]] $S \in \mathcal{L}(W,V)$ such that $ST$ equals the [[identity map]] on $V$ and $TS$ equals the [[identity map]] on $W$.

A linear map $S \in \mathcal{L}(W,V)$ satisfying $ST = I$ and $TS = I$ is called an **inverse** of $T$ (note that the first $I$ is the identity map on $V$ and the second $I$ is the identity map on $W$).

If $T$ is invertible, the its inverse is denoted by $T^{-1}$.

###### Properties:
- An invertible linear map has a unique inverse
- A linear map is invertible if and only if it is [[injective]] and [[surjective]]
