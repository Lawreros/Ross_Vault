###### Content:
The matrix $A \in M_n$ is negative semidefinite if it is a [[Hermitian]] matrix with eigenvalues which are real and less than or equal to 0.

Let $A\in M_n$ be Hermitian, it is negative semidefinite if $\forall x \in \mathbb{C}^n$ that $x^*Ax \leq 0$. In other words, by the [[Rayleigh-Ritz  method]], $A$ is NSD if and only if the [[spectrum]] $\sigma(A) \subseteq \mathbb{R}_{\l eq 0 }$.
