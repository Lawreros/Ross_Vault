###### Content:
The nth moment of the [[random variable]] $X$ is the [[expectation]] $E(X^n)$. It is the expected value of the nth power of the deviations about that number. In the case of [[discrete random variable]]s, the nth moment is calculated by $$E(X^n) = \sum_k k^nP(X=k)$$ If $X$ has [[probability density function]] $F$ its nth moment is given by $$E(X^n) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} x^n f(x) dx$$

###### Properties:
- The second moment $E(X^2)$ is called the *mean square*
