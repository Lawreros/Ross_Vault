A technique for converting a quadratic polynomial of the form $$ax^2+bx+c$$ into the form $$a(x-h)^2+k$$ for some value of $h$ and $k$ (and vice versa).


**Example:**
Consider the following quadratic polynomial: $$x+10x+28$$ The quadratic is not a perfect square, since 28 is not the square of 5:$$(x+5)^2=x^2+10x+25$$ However it is possible to write the original quadratic as the sum of this square and a constant: $$x^2+10x+28=(x+5)^2+3$$
