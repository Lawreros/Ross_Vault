###### Content:
An orthonormal basis of [[inner product space]] $V$ is an [[orthonormal]] list of vectors in $V$ that is also a [[basis]] of $V$.

###### Properties:
- Every finite dimensional inner product space has an orthonomal basis.
- An orthonormal list of the right length is an orthonormal basis. Every orthonormal list of vectors in $V$ with length dim $V$ is an orthonormal basis of $V$
- Suppose $V$ is finite dimensional, then every orthonormal list of vectors in $V$ can be extended to an orthonormal basis of $V$.
- Writing a vector as [[linear combination]] of orthonormal basis. Suppose $e_1,...,e_n$ is an orthonormal basis of [[inner product space]] $V$ and $v \in V$. Then $$v = \langle v , e_1 \rangle + ... + \langle v, e_n \rangle e_n$$ and $$||v||^2 = |\langle v, e_1 \rangle |^2 + ... + | \langle v, e_n \rangle |^2$$ (see [[norm]])


(DELETE AS ALREADY IN UPPER-TRIANGULAR MATRIX)Upper-triangular matrix with respect to [[orthonormal basis]]. Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. If $T$ has an upper-triangular matrix with respect to some basis of $V$, then $T$ has an upper-triangular matrix with respect to some orthonormal basis of $V$.
