A probability distribution (also called a probability measure or simply probability) $P$ is a function from a collection of events in a [[sample space]] $\mathcal{F} \in \Omega$ into the real number line. Each event $A$ has a probability $P(A)$, and $P$ satisfies the following axioms:
1. $0 \leq P(A) \leq 1$ for each event $A$
2. $P(\Omega) = 1$ and $P(\emptyset) = 0$
3. If $A_1, A_2, A_3,...$ is a sequence of [[mutually exclusive events]] then $$P(\bigcup_{i=1}^\infty A_i) = \sum_{i=1}^\infty P(A_i)$$
