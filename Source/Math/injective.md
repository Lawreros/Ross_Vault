###### Content:
A function $T : V \rightarrow W$ is called injective if $Tu = Tv$ implies $u = v$. In other words, $T$ is injective if it maps distinct inputs to distinct outputs.

###### Properties:
- Easy way to check is to test whether 0 is the only vector that gets mapped to 0. Injectivity is equivalent to "[[null space]] equals {0}"
		- Let $T \in \mathcal{L}(V,W)$. Then $T$ is injective if and only if null $T$ = {0}
