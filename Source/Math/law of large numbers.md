###### Content:
In probability theory, the law of large numbers is a theorem which states that the average of the results obtained from a large number of trials should be close to the [[expectation]] and tends to become closer to the expected value as more trials are performed.

**Law of large numbers for variables with [[binomial distribution]]:**
Let $S_n \sim Bin(n,p)$. For any fixed $\epsilon >0$ we have: $$\underset{n\rightarrow \infty}{lim} P(|\frac{S_n}{n}-p|< \epsilon) = 1$$
