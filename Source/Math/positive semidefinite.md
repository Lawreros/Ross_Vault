###### Content:
The matrix $A \in M_n$ is positive semidefinite if it is a [[Hermitian]] matrix with eigenvalues which are real and greater than or equal to 0.

Let $A\in M_n$ be Hermitian, it is positive semidefinite if $\forall x \in \mathbb{C}^n$ that $x^*Ax \geq 0$. In other words, by the [[Rayleigh-Ritz  method]], $A$ is PSD if and only if the [[spectrum]] $\sigma(A) \subseteq \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0 }$.
