The matrix $A \in M_n$ is negative definite if it is a [[Hermitian]] matrix with eigenvalues which are real and less than 0.

Let $A\in M_n$ be Hermitian, it is negative definite if $\forall x \in \mathbb{C}^n$ that $x^*Ax < 0$. In other words, by the [[Rayleigh-Ritz  method]], $A$ is ND if and only if the [[spectrum]] $\sigma(A) \subseteq \mathbb{R}_{< 0 }$.
