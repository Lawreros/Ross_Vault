###### Content:
A linear map from $V$ to $W$ is a function $T:V \rightarrow W$ with the following properties:

**additivity**
$T(u+v) = Tu +Tv$ for all $u,v \in V$

**homogeneity**
$T(\lambda v) = \lambda (Tv)$ for all $\lambda \in \textbf{F}$ and all $v \in V$

The set of all linear maps from $V$ to $W$ is denoted $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$

###### Properties:
- $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ is a [[vector space]]
- Suppose that $T$ is a linear map from $V$ to $W$. Then $T(0) = 0$.
- Linear maps act like matrix multiplication. Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V,W)$ and $v\in V$. Suppose $v_1,...,v_n$ is a [[basis]] of $V$ and $w_1,...,w_m$ is a basis of $W$. Then $\mathcal{M}(Tv)=\mathcal{M}(T)\mathcal{M}(v)$
- Suppose $V$ and $W$ are finite-[[dimension]]al. Then $\mathcal{L}(V,W)$ is finite-dimensional  and $dim \mathcal{L}(V,W) = (dim V) (dim W)$
