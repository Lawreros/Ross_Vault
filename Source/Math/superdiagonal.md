The superdiagonal of a [[square matrix]] is the set of elements directly above the elements comprising the [[diagonal]]. For example, in the following matrix, the diagonal elements are denoted $d_i$ and the superdiagonal elements are denoted $s_i$:
$$\begin{bmatrix} d_1 & s_1 & * & * \\
* & d_1 & s_1 & * \\
* & * & d_1 & s_1 \\
* & * & * & d_1 \\
\end{bmatrix}$$
