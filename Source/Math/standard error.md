The standard error is a statistical term that measures the accuracy with which a [[sampling distribution]] represents a population by using [[standard deviation]]. 

The term "standard error" is used to refer to the standard deviation of various sample statistics, such as the mean or median. For example, the "standard error of the mean" refers to the standard deviation of the distribution of [[sample mean]]s taken from a population. The smaller the standard error, the more representative the sample will be of the overall population.

The relationship between the standard error and the standard deviation is such that, for a given sample size, the standard error equals the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size. The standard error is also inversely proportional to the sample size; the larger the sample size, the smaller the standard error because the statistic will approach the actual value.

The standard error of an estimate can be calculated as the standard deviation divided by the square root of the sample size:
$$SE = \frac{\sigma}{\sqrt n}$$
where $\sigma$ is the population standard deviation, and $\sqrt{n}$ is the square root of the sample size.

###### Properties:
- The more data points involved in the calculations of the mean, the smaller the standard error tends to be. When the standard error is small, the data is said to be more representative of the true mean. In cases where the standard error is large, the data may have some notable irregularities.
