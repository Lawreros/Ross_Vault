###### Content:
For $T \in \mathcal{L}(V,W)$, the null space of $T$, denoted null $T$, is the subset of $V$ consisting of those vectors that $T$ maps to 0:
$$\text{null} T = \{v \in V : Tv = 0 \}$$

###### Properties:
- If $T$ is the zero map from $V$ to $W$, in other words if $Tv = 0$ for every $v \in V$, then $\text{null}T = V$
- Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V,W)$. Then null $T$ is a [[subspace]] of $V$.
