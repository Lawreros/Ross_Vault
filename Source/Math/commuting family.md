###### Content:
A commuting family is a [[family of matrices]] in which every pair of matrices commutes ([[commutativity]]).

###### Properties:
- For a given $A \in M_n$, a [[subspace]] $W \subseteq \textbf{C}^n$ is $A$-invariant if $Aw \in W$ for every $w \in W$. A subspace $W \subseteq \textbf{C}^n$ is trivial if either $W = \{0\}$ or $W = \textbf{C}^n$; otherwise, it is nontrivial.
- For a given family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq M_n$, a subspace $W \subseteq \textbf{C}^n$ is $\mathcal{F}$-invariant if $W$ is $A$-invariant for each $A\in\mathcal{F}$. 
- A given family $\mathcal{F} \subseteq M_n$ is reducible if some nontrivial subspace of $\textbf{C}^n$ is $\mathcal{F}$-invariant; otherwise, $\mathcal{F}$ is irreducible.
- Let $\mathcal{F} \subset M_n$ be a commuting family. Then some nonzero vector in $\textbf{C}^n$ is an [[eigenvector]] of every $A \in \mathcal{F}$
- Let $\mathcal{F} \subset M_n$ be a family of [[diagonal matrix]]es. Then $\mathcal{F}$ is a commuting family if and only if it is a [[simultaneously diagonalizable]] family. Moreover, for any given $A_0 \in \mathcal{F}$ and for any given ordering $\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n$ of the [[eigenvalue]]s of $A_0$, there is a nonsingular $S \in M_n$, such that $S^{-1}A_0S = diag(\lambda_1,...,\lambda_n)$ and $S^{-1}BS$ is diagonal for every $B \in \mathcal{F}$
