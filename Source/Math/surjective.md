###### Content:
A function $T: V \rightarrow W$ is called surjective if its [[range]] equals $W$.

###### Properties:
- Whether a linear map is surjective depends on what we are thinking of as the vector space into which it maps.
- Due to [[Fundamental Theorem of Linear Maps]], a map to a larger dimensional space is not surjective:
		- Suppose $V$ and $W$ are [[finite-dimensional vector space]]s such that dim $V$ < dim $W$. Then no [[linear map]] from $V$ to $W$ is surjective
