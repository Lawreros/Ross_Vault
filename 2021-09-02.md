### Jumping off points


### Train of thought:
- Got hair cut this morning
- Focus of today's work is both the rich-club python notebook, as well as the addition of stuff into Anki. I want to start being able to use Anki as study material.
- Also important is the conversion of some of my notes from class into obsidian notes. Unfortunately, I might need some way to get things clustered in a way that makes sense for review. Should what I include in these daily notes cover the keywords from each class?
- Converted quite a few notes into Anki
- [[Lp norm]]
- [[convex set]]
- [[convex function]]
- [[objective function]]
- I guess my standard going forward should be to add 5 new obsidian notes every day from my notes/textbook. That can be reinforced by adding 10 new Anki cards per day (that should be enough, right? I don't see myself really learning too much between classes...)
