#### Common Concepts
- [[batch learning]]
- [[online learning]]
- [[instance-based learning]]
- [[model-based learning]]


#### Supervised Learning ([[supervised learning]])
In supervised learning, the training data you feed the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called *labels*:
- k-nearest neighbors
- [[linear regression]]
- logistic regression
- support vector machines (SVMs)
		- Linear SVM Classification
			- Soft Margin Classification
		- Nonlinear SVM Classification
			- Polynomial Kernel
			- Adding Similarity Features
			- Gaussian RBF Kernel
			- Computational Complexity
		- SVM Regression
- decision tree and random forest
- neural networks

#### Unsupervised Learning ([[unsupervised learning]])
In unsupervised learning, the training data is unlabeled, causing the system to try a learn without a teacher.
- Clustering:
		- K-means
		- DBSCAN
		- hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA)
- Anomaly detection and novelty detection
		- one-class SVM
		- isolation forest
- Visualization and dimensionality reduction
		- principal component analysis (PCA)
		- kernel PCA
		- locally-linear embedding (LLE)
		- t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE)
- Association rule learning
		- Apriori
		- Eclat

#### Semisupervised learning ([[semisupervised learning]])
Algorithms that can deal with partially labeled training data, usually a lot of unlabeled data and a little bit of labeled data.
-	deep belief networks (DBNs)
-	restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs)

#### Performance Metrics
- [[cross-validation]]
- [[confusion matrix]]
- [[precision]]
- [[recall]]
- [[ROC curve]]
- [[AUC]]
