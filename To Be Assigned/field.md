###### Content:
A field is a [[set]] containing at least two distinct elements called 0 and 1, along with operations of addition and multiplication following the following properties:
- [[commutativity]]
- [[associativity]]
- [[additive identity]]
- [[multiplicative identity]]
- [[additive inverse]]
- [[multiplicative inverse]]
- [[distributive property]]

###### Properties:
- **R** and **C** are fields, as is the set of rational numbers along with the usual operations of addition and multiplication.
- $\{0,1\}$ is also considered a field, with the usual operations of addition and multiplication except that $1+1$ is defined to equal 0.
- Many definitions, theorems, and proofs in linear algebra that work for both **R** and **C** also work without change for arbitrary fields.
