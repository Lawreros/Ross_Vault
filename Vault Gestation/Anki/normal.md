###### Content:
 An [[operator]] on an [[inner product space]] is called normal if it commutes with it's adjoint ([[conjugate transpose]]). $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is said to be normal if $T^*T = TT^*$

###### Properties:
- $T$ is normal if and only if $||Tv|| = ||T^*v||$ for all $v$. An operator $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is normal if and only if $||Tv|| = ||T^*v||$ for all $v \in V$
- For $T$ [[normal]], $T$ and $T^*$ have the same [[eigenvector]]s. Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is normal and $v \in V$ is an eigenvector of $T$ with [[eigenvalue]] $\lambda$. Then $v$ is also an eigenvector of $T^*$ with eigenvalue $\bar \lambda$.
- [[orthogonal]] eigenvectors for normal operators. Suppose $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$ is normal. Then eigenvectors of $T$ corresponding to distinct eigenvalues are orthogonal.
