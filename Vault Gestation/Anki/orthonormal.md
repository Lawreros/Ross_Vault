###### Content:
A list of vectors is called orthonormal if each vector in the list has [[norm]] 1 and is [[orthogonal]] to all the other vectors in the list.
In other words, a list $e_1,...,e_m$ of vectiors in the [[inner product space]] $V$ is orthonormal if $$\langle e_j, e_k \rangle = 
\left\{ \begin{array}{rcl} 1  & \mbox{if} & j=k \\
0 & \mbox{if} & j \neq k
\end{array}\right. $$

###### Properties:
- The norm of an orthonormal linear combination. If $e_1,...,e_m$ is an orthonormal list of vectors in $V$, then $$||a_1e_1 + ... + a_me_m||^2 = |a_1|^2+...+|a_m|^2$$ for all $a_1,...,a_m \in \textbf{F}$
- Every orthonormal list of vectors is [[linearly independent]]
