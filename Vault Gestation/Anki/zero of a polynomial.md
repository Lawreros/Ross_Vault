###### Content:
A number $\lambda \in \textbf{F}$ is called a zero (or root) of a [[polynomial]] $p \in \mathcal{P}(\textbf{F})$ if $$p(\lambda) = 0$$

###### Properties:
- Each zero of a polynomial corresponds to a degree-1 [[factor]]. Suppose $p \in \mathcal{P}(\textbf{F})$ and $\lambda \in \textbf{F}$. Then $p(\lambda) = 0$ if and only if there is a polynomial $q \in \mathcal{P}(\textbf{F})$ such that $p(z) = (z - \lambda)q(z)$ for every $z \in \textbf{F}$
- A polynomial has at most as many zeros as its degree. Suppose $p \in \mathcal{P}(\textbf{F})$ is a polynomial with [[degree of a polynomial]] $m \geq 0$. Then $p$ has at most $m$ distinct zeros in $\textbf{F}$.
