###### Content:
The alternative hypothesis is the *alternative* to the [[null hypothesis]]. In many cases, the alternate hypothesis will just be the opposite of the null hypothesis. In other cases, there might be a change in the amount of something. 

For example, let’s say a Gallup poll predicts an election will re-elect a president with a 5 percent majority. However, you, the researcher, has uncovered a secret grassroots campaign composed of hundreds of thousands of minorities who are going to vote the opposite way from expected.

- Null hypothesis: President re-elected with 5 percent majority
- Alternate hypothesis: President re-elected with 1-2 percent majority.

Although the outcome hasn’t changed (the President is still re-elected), the majority percentage has changed—which may be important to an electoral campaign.

###### Properties:
- The alternate hypothesis is usually what you will be testing in hypothesis testing. It’s a statement that you or another researcher) thinks is true and one that can ultimately lead you to reject the null hypothesis and replace it with the alternate hypothesis.
