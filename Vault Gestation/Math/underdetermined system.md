###### Content:
A system of linear equations or a system of polynomial equations is considered underdetermined if there are fewer equations that unknowns (in contrast to an [[overdetermined system]])

###### Properties:
- For a linear system $Ax=b$, where, $m > n$, $A \in \textbf{R}^{n\times m}$,  $b \in \textbf{R}^{n}$, $x \in \textbf{R}^{m}$ :
	- There are no solutions when $b \notin span(A)$
	- There are infinite solutions when $b \in span(A)$ and $rank(A)=n$
