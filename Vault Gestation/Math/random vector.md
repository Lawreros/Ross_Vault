###### Content:
A random vector is a vector consisting of [[random variable]]s. If $X_1, X_2,...,X_n$ are random variables defined on a [[sample space]] $\Omega$, we can regard them as coordinates of the random vector $(X_1,X_2,...,X_n)$. This vector is again a "random variable" in the sense of being a function on $\Omega$, but instead of being real valued it is $\mathbb{R}^n$ valued.

###### Properties:
- The concepts related to a single random variable can be adapted to a random vector, see [[joint probability distribution]]
