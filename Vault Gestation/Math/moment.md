###### Content:
In mathematics, the moments of a function are quantitative measures related to the shape of the function's graph. If the function represents mass, then the first moment is the center of mass, and the second moment is the rotational inertia. If the function is a [[probability distribution]], then the first moment is the [[expectation]], the second is the [[variance]], and so on.
