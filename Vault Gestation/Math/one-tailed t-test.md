###### Content:
A one-tailed [[t-test]] is used if the mean of one group is expected to deviate from the mean of the other group in only one direction. Using the [[Student's t-distribution]] and [[degrees of freedom]], [[statistical significance]] can be calculate by seeing if the [[t-value]] falls above/below the one-sided critical value. This is done by calculating the [[t-value]] and comparing it to a table of values (see Properties) for the different probabilities

This method is mainly used when you care about the direction of the difference between the means of both groups.
