###### Content:
A stochastic (or random) process is the process of some values changing randomly "over time" and are widely used as mathematical models of systems and phenomena that appear to vary in a random manner.
*Think of the Random Walk problem, where the person either steps to the right, left, or stays still based on a probability of each outcome. Where the person ends up is random, but can be modeled as a stochastic process and expected values can be calculated.*
*Or you can think of flipping a coin multiple times, keeping track of the total number of heads. The number of heads will be represented by a stochastic process.*

A stochastic process is defined as a collection of [[random variable]]s defined on a common [[probability space]] and the random variables, indexed by some set $T$ all take values in the same mathematical space $S$, which must be measurable.
In other words, for a given probability space, a stochastic process is a collection of $S$-valued random variables, which can be written as: $$\{X(t):t \in T\}$$

**Common examples:**
- [[poisson process]]
- [[markov chain]]
- random walks
- [[bernoulli process]]
