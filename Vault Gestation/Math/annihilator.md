###### Content:
For $U \subset V$, the annihilator of $U$, denoted $U^0$, is defined by
$U^0 = \{\varphi \in V' : \varphi(u) = 0$ for all $u \in U \}$

###### Properties:
- The annihilator is a [[subspace]]. Suppose $U \subset V$. Then $U^0$ is a subspace of $V'$
- [[dimension]] of the annihilator. Suppose $V$ is a [[finite-dimensional vector space]] and $U$ is a subspace of $V$. Then $dim U + dim U^0 = dim V$.
