###### Content:
 A set in a [[vector space]], $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$ is convex if, for any $x,y \in S$ and scalar $\alpha \in [0,1]$, the convex combination is also in $S$. More precisely, if $$\alpha x + (1-\alpha)y \in S$$

In other words, imagine a 2D plane, if you were to draw a line between two points, all points on the line would also be on the plane.
