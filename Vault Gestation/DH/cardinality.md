###### Content:
In mathematics, the cardinality of a [[set]] is a measure of the number of elements of the [[set]]. For example, the set $A = \{2,4,6\}$ contains 3 elements, and therefore $A$ has a cardinality of 3. The cardinality of a set $A$ is usually denoted $|A|$.

###### Properties:
- The cardinality of a [[set]] may alternatively be denoted by $n(A)$, $\bar {\bar A}$, $card(A)$, or $\#A$
