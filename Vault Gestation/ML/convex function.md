###### Content:
A function $f : \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$ is convex if given $x,y \in \mathbb{R}^n$ and $\alpha \in [0,1]$ $$f(\alpha x + (1-\alpha)y) \leq \alpha f(x) +(1-\alpha)f(y)$$

In other words, a function is convex if the line between any two points is greater than the value of the function at any point between those two points. Think the equation $y = x^2$, if you select any two points along the curve in the figure and draw a line between them, you will not intersect the curve aside from those two points.
