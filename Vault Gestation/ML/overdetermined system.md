###### Content:
A system of equations is considered overdetermined if there are more equations than unknowns (opposite of [[underdetermined system]]). An overdetermined system is almost always inconsistent (it has no solution) when constructed with random coefficients. However, an overdetermined system will have solutions in some cases, for example if some equation occurs several times in the system, or if some equations are linear combinations of the others.
