###### Content:
The subdifferential of $f$ is the set of all subgradients at a point $x$, and denoted by:
$\partial f(x) = \{g:g\text{ is a subgradient of f at x}\}$

Think of a subgradient as a gradient/line which intersects $f(x)$ at point $x$ but stays below/inside the convex function. In other words, the red lines in this picture:

###### Properties:
- For differentiable functions, the only vector in the subdifferential is the gradient; $\partial f(x) = \{\nabla f(x)\}$
