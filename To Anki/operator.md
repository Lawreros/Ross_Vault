###### Content:
A [[linear map]] from a [[vector space]] to itself is called an operator. The notation $\mathcal{L}(V)$ denotes the set of all operators on $V$. In other words, $\mathcal{L}(V)=\mathcal{L}(V,V)$.

###### Properties:
- Suppose $V$ is a [[finite-dimensional vector space]] and $T \in \mathcal{L}(V)$. Then the following are equivalent:
		- $T$ is [[invertible]]
		- $T$ is [[injective]]
		- $T$ is [[surjective]]
