###### Content:
A [[vector space]] is called infinite-dimensional if it is not a [[finite-dimensional vector space]]

###### Properties:
- [[polynomial]]s are infinite dimensional:
	- Consider any list of elements of $\mathcal{P}(\textbf{F})$. Let $m$ denote the highest degree of the polynomials in this list. Then every polynomial in the [[span]] of this list has degree at most $m$. Thus $z^{m+1}$ is not in the [[span]] of our list. Hence no list spans $\mathcal{P}(\textbf{F})$. Thus $\mathcal{P}(\textbf{F})$ is infinite-dimensional.
